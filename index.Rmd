# Preface {-}

This is a case study from Chapter 3 of _Data Science in R_ [@Nolan:2015:DSR:2821191]. Most of the words in the following chapters are not my own. My goal is to follow along with the case study, using tools from the [tidyverse](tidyverse.org) instead of the base R that is used in _Data Science in R_. That is not to say that the tidyverse is necessarily better than base R; I just prefer it for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. Any work done in the "Exercises" section is entirely my own.
